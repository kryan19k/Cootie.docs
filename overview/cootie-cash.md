Tokenomics for Cootie Cash Introduction: Cootie Cash (CASH) is a utility token designed to power the Cooties NFT ecosystem. The token has a total supply of 1 billion coins, which will serve as the primary currency for the Cooties Metaverse and various Dapps within the ecosystem. \
\
Token Distribution: \
20% of the total supply will be reserved for liquidity pools. \
25% will be reserved for staking rewards. \
20% will be reserved for strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives. \
20% will be available for private sale and public sale. \

\
Deflation: Cootie Cash has a planned deflation mechanism, where 0.01% of the total supply will be burned for each token transfer, reducing the total supply over time. This mechanism is designed to increase the scarcity of the token and increase its value over time. \
\
Liquidity Pools: A portion of the token supply will be allocated to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to increase the token's liquidity and trading volume. Providing liquidity to the pools will earn users a share of the network's staking rewards. \
\
Staking: Staking Cootie Cash will earn users a share of the network's staking rewards, as well as support the security and stability of the network. The staking rewards will incentivize users to hold and actively use their Cootie Cash. \
\
Partnerships: Cootie Cash will seek strategic partnerships with other NFT projects and gaming companies to expand its reach and increase its utility. A portion of the token supply will be used to incentivize and support these partnerships. \
\
Marketing: A significant portion of the token supply will be dedicated to marketing initiatives aimed at raising awareness of Cootie Cash and its use cases. The goal is to increase demand for the token and drive growth for the ecosystem. \
\
Development Fund: A portion of the token supply will be dedicated to a development fund to support the ongoing development and improvement of the Cooties NFT ecosystem. The fund will help ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.&#x20;

In addition to the deflation mechanism, the tokenomics of Cootie Cash also emphasize community involvement and decentralization.

By providing liquidity and helping to secure the network through staking, users can earn rewards while also helping to ensure the long-term success of the project.

By partnering with other NFT projects and gaming companies, Cootie Cash can tap into new markets and provide additional use cases for its token. The marketing initiatives, meanwhile, will help to raise awareness of Cootie Cash and drive adoption of the token.

Overall, the tokenomics of Cootie Cash are designed to create a sustainable, self-reinforcing ecosystem that rewards users for their contributions and incentivizes them to become active participants in the network.
