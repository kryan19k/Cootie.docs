# ü¶ä Add Songbird to Metamask

### Configuring MetaMask Wallet For Songbird Network | Flare Network

If you used an ETH address from a MetaMask wallet, you can access your $SGB tokens by connecting to the Songbird Network directly in MetaMask, by following the steps outlined below.

If you haven‚Äôt already got [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) installed, you‚Äôll need to download it [here](https://metamask.io/).

Metamask is supported on the following browsers ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre using Chrome for this demo

Once installed, you‚Äôll need to import the wallet you‚Äôve previously created.

When you‚Äôve successfully added your wallet, select the drop down in the top right hand corner, currently set to ‚ÄúEthereum Mainnet‚Äù.

You need to select ‚ÄúCustom RPC‚Äù at the bottom of the list.

Your dialog box should now look like this, then hit save.

You‚Äôll now see Songbird in the top right hand corner which will mean you‚Äôve successfully set up the Songbird Network and your Metamask Wallet.

The Songbird wallet will display and show your $SGB token amount.

While still in the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù tab, scroll to the bottom and select ‚ÄúAdd Token‚Äù so you can add $WSGB.

In the address field you need to enter: 0x02f0826ef6aD107Cfc861152B32B52fD11BaB9ED

The Token Symbol and Token Decimal will automatically populate with WSGB and 18. Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù then ‚ÄúAdd Tokens‚Äù.

If you select ‚ÄúSongbird‚Äù you‚Äôll see a dropdown box where you can change between networks as required.

**iPhone App Instructions**

The process will be just the same for setting it up on an iPhone.

When the app has been installed and you‚Äôve imported your wallet you‚Äôll need to select the 3 horizontal bars in the top left hand corner.

From there you‚Äôll select Settings > Networks > Add Network and fill out the following fields.
