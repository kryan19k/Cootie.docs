Genesis Cootie V1 Staking.\
This staking module is currently in beta testing with subject to change. users can earn up to 0.00002 COOT per NFT each second. \
\
If you you were staked in original staking Dapp, users can click the "withdraw all" button to un-stake from the older contract and re-stake to the new. This will pull up a wallet transaction request for each NFT staked. Could take awhile depending on how many NFTS you had staked in the old contract.
